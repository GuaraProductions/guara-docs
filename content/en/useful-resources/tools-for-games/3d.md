Attention: always remember to check the licenses of any model you find on the internet.

In general, you want to find models in the .gltf format, but here is some general information about the main types of 3D models:

## 3D File Formats

### GLTF (.gltf, .glb)
GLTF (GL Transmission Format) is a modern and highly efficient format for transmitting and loading 3D scenes and models. Godot offers full support for this format.
* **Advantages:** Support for animations, PBR (Physical Based Rendering) materials, lighting, and other complex data.
* **Formats:** `.glb` is the compressed binary version, while `.gltf` is the JSON version with references to other files.
* **Usage:** Fast reading and writing, ideal for games and real-time applications.

### OBJ (.obj)
A simple and widely supported file format used primarily for storing 3D mesh geometry.
* **Advantages:** Easy to edit and convert; basic support for materials and textures (with an associated `.mtl` file).
* **Disadvantages:** Does not support animations or advanced data like lighting and PBR materials.

### FBX (.fbx)
FBX (Filmbox) is a proprietary format from Autodesk that supports a wide variety of 3D data, including animations, cameras, and lights.
* **Advantages:** Support for complex animations and wide adoption in game and film production pipelines.
* **Disadvantages:** Being proprietary, it can cause compatibility issues; it tends to be heavier than GLTF.

### Collada (.dae)
Collada is an XML-based format that allows data exchange between different 3D applications.
* **Advantages:** Support for a vast range of data (animations, cameras, lights).
* **Disadvantages:** Generates larger files and is less efficient at loading compared to GLTF.

## Where to find models

### 1. Quaternius
Arguably the closest spiritual successor to Kenney. Offers several themed "Game Kits" (Medieval, Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, Nature) with optimized and animated low-poly models.
* **License:** CC0 (Public Domain).
* **Highlight:** Almost all characters come pre-rigged with skeletons and basic animations.
* **Link:** [quaternius.com](https://quaternius.com/)

### 2. Kay Lousberg (KayKit)
Kay creates high-quality modular packs with a very clean and charismatic art style. The packs are divided by themes such as dungeons, cities, and RPG characters.
* **License:** CC0.
* **Highlight:** Models are extremely modular, allowing you to build complex scenes like LEGO pieces.
* **Link:** [kaykit.itch.io](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/)

### 3. Poly Haven
Focused on realism and technical quality, it is the gold standard library for those seeking PBR (Physical Based Rendering) assets.
* **License:** CC0.
* **Highlight:** In addition to 3D models (rocks, furniture, tools), it is the best free source for HDRIs (skies) and high-resolution textures.
* **Link:** [polyhaven.com](https://polyhaven.com/)

### 4. Itch.io (Tag: Free 3D Assets)
Itch.io is an open marketplace where many independent artists post their asset packs.
* **How to search:** Use filters for "CC0" licenses and tags like "Low Poly" or "Game Assets".
* **Recommended artists:** In addition to KayKit, look for **Zacksly** and **Suno**.
* **Link:** [itch.io/game-assets/free/3d](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/3d)

### 5. OpenGameArt.org
One of the oldest repositories on the internet. The interface is dated, but the content is vast and entirely focused on open source.
* **Highlight:** Great for finding specific models that might not exist in modern themed packs.
* **Link:** [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/)

### 6. Poly Pizza
One of the most user-friendly tools for developers seeking low-poly style 3D models (low polygon count).
* **Highlight:** Features a built-in 3D viewer in the browser and fast downloads in formats ideal for Godot (.glb/.gltf).
