Learning to program is the fundamental foundation for anyone who wants to create games professionally and independently. Starting with structural concepts helps in understanding how logic works even before touching an engine like Godot.

## Recommended Resources

### 1. CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)
Considered the best introductory computer science course in the world. It teaches you how to think like a computer scientist and covers logic, algorithms, and data structures.
* **Portuguese Version:** There are complete translations available in Brazilian Portuguese.
* **Highlight:** Ideal for those who want a solid foundation rather than just learning to "copy code."

### 2. Book: C How to Program
The book by **H. M. Deitel** (or similar introductory C language books) is an academic classic. The C language is often chosen for initial teaching because it is "low-level," allowing one to understand how memory and the computer actually work.
* **Highlight:** Great for those who prefer theoretical and structured study. It helps immensely in understanding what happens under the hood in engines that use C++ or C#.
* **Where to find:** Available in university libraries and major bookstores.

## Tips for the Beginning

* **Focus on Logic:** Before trying to make a complex game, understand the basics.
* **Practice Daily:** Programming is a mental muscle-building skill; consistency is more important than intensity.
* **Don't Skip Steps:** Trying to learn game creation in Godot without knowing basic logic can cause unnecessary frustration.
