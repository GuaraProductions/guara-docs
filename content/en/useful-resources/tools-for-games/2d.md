Attention: always remember to check the licenses of any visual resource you find on the internet. In the 2D world, resolutions and compression formats (such as .png or .atlas) are fundamental for performance.

## Formats

### PNG (.png)
The most widely used format in game development due to its native support for transparency (alpha channel) and lossless data compression.
* **Advantages:** Maintains full sharpness, ideal for Pixel Art and user interfaces (UI).
* **Usage:** The standard for sprites and textures that require precise cutouts.

### WebP (.webp)
A modern format that offers excellent compression while maintaining transparency and high quality with significantly smaller files than PNG.
* **Advantages:** Reduces the final size of the game build without visibly sacrificing quality.
* **Usage:** Recommended for large textures, backgrounds, and elements that do not need absolute pixel precision (non-pixel art).

### JPG (.jpg, .jpeg)
A lossy compression format that does not support transparency.
* **Advantages:** Very lightweight files for complex images.
* **Disadvantages:** May show compression artifacts and is not suitable for sprites that need a transparent background.
* **Usage:** Ideal for opaque terrain textures or background art (splash screens) that occupy the entire screen.

## 2D Techniques

### Sprite Sheets
The most common format for 2D animations, where multiple frames are placed in a single image to optimize GPU processing.
* **Usage in Godot:** Can be easily cropped using the `Sprite2D` node with the `Animation` properties (Hframes and Vframes).

### Tilemaps
A level construction system based on small repeating squares (tiles), saving memory and facilitating level design.
* **Usage in Godot:** The `TileMapLayer` node allows for the automated creation of collisions, navigation, and terrain layers.
